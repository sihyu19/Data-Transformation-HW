```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

#filter()
#arrange()
#select()
#mutate()
#summarize()
#group_by()

```
1. 
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, 4, 6, 7, 9)
select(flights, "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
```

2. 
The duplication is ignored. 
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time)
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

3. 
```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, any_of(vars))
```

4. 
It doesn't really surprise me(I don't know what surpirses the author is expecting me to have). The contains() function picks out all the coloumns that has "time" in it. 

```{r}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
